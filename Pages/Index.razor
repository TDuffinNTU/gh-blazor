    <h1 class="mt-5 font-bold text-lg">About me.</h1>

    <p class="mt-5">
        Born in 1998, I moved to Nottingham for university in 2017
        to study computer science and game design. 
        
        I've always been a computer nerd since we got out first family computer (some kind of
        windows 95 E-Machines thing) which I spent hours on researching anything
        and everything! Minecraft motivated me to pursue programming as I approached college.
